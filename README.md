# 👋🏽 Hi there, I'm Emmaculata Sanga

🎓 Soon-to-be Cybersecurity Master's graduate | 🔐 Junior Cybersecurity Analyst | 🛡️ Security Enthusiast | 🌊 Weekend Jet Skier

## 🧠 About Me

I'm a passionate cybersecurity analyst with hands-on experience in **SIEM (Splunk), GRC, vulnerability management**, and cloud platforms like **AWS and Azure**. I thrive at the intersection of compliance, threat detection, and clear documentation.

Currently, I’m building a portfolio of realistic labs where I:

- Hunt for threats using Splunk and open-source logs
- Simulate vulnerability scans using Nessus
- Write NIST-aligned security policies
- Investigate rogue AI in a storytelling-style security project
- Practice real-world incident response techniques in easy-to-follow mini labs

> “Good security isn't loud — it's layered, logged, and always improving.”
